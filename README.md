# Methodology
Upon analysis of Brazil's inclusive internet index in comparison to that of the United States, certain findings have been noted.

![iamge_1](./images/Picture6.jpg)    ![iamge_1](./images/Picture7.jpg) 

The clustering analysis shows that Brazil's average literacy rate is 93.2%. This indicates room for improvement in literacy rates within the country. Low literacy rates hinder educational development and limit individuals' full participation in society.
A comparison of education levels between Brazil and the United States shows a significant difference. On average, Brazil has 7.8 years of schooling, while the United States has 13.4 years. It is evident that there is a need to improve education in Brazil to address this gap and provide better opportunities for its citizens.

Additionally, the Harvard political review article highlights the dichotomous educational reality in Brazil, where access to quality education is unequal. Particularly, Young people living in poverty, especially in marginalized areas, face significant exclusion from the education system. The country also struggles with high illiteracy rates, with 40% of adults lacking primary education and 6.8% of the population being illiterate. (Pimentel, 2022)
The information above highlights the issues in the Brazilian education system, especially the inequalities between different socioeconomic classes and races. It shows that there is a pressing need for initiatives like the RaízesVivas app to tackle these problems and give everyone a chance to improve their education and social standing.
